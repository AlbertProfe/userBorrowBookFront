# userBorrowBook front

## Intro and links

- The `Books.jsx` and `Users.jsx` components are simple tables displaying data fetched via Axios.

- You can expand the `Edit` and `Delete` functionality in the future.

- The `Borrows.jsx` page is just a placeholder for now.

**material ui**

Ensure you have Material-UI installed (`@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, and `@emotion/styled`) and Axios (`npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled axios`).

To install Material-UI (now called MUI) along with its required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material
```

**react-router-dom**

To install react-router-dom, use the following npm command:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

This will install the latest version of react-router-dom in your project[3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom). If you encounter any issues, you can try using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom --legacy-peer-deps
```

After installation, you can import and use react-router-dom in your React application.

**axios**

To install Axios using npm, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install axios
```
